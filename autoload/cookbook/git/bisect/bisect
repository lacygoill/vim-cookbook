# Purpose: Find out the first commit from which Vim supports the `win_gettype()` function.
# Usage:{{{
#
#     # run this command first! (it can change the commit you're currently on)
#     $ git bisect reset
#
#     $ git bisect start --term-old ok --term-new nope
#     $ git bisect nope <new_commit> && git bisect ok <old_commit>
#
#     # make sure the "bisect" script is executable
#     $ git bisect run /tmp/bisect
#}}}

make clean
make distclean
./configure
# Why `125`?{{{
#
# If the compilation  fails, we don't want `git-bisect(1)` to  interpret that as
# meaning that VimÂ exhibits the new behavior whose origin we're trying to bisect.
# We want it to skip the commit.
#
# From `man git-bisect /special exit code`:
#
# >   The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source code
# >   cannot be tested. If the script exits with this code, the current
# >   revision will be skipped.
#}}}
make || exit 125
# You may need to pass a file argument to Vim:{{{
#
#     ./src/vim -Nu NONE -U NONE -i NONE -S /tmp/bisect.vim some_file
#                                                           ^-------^
#}}}
./src/vim -Nu NONE -U NONE -i NONE -S /tmp/bisect.vim
